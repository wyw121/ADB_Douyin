# Repository Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Project Overview

This is an advanced AI-driven Android automation framework for Douyin (TikTok Chinese version) that uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to intelligently automate social interactions. The project implements a fully autonomous, modular architecture designed for AI agent integration, self-improvement, and zero-human-interaction operation.

**Primary Goal**: Create a fully autonomous, AI-agent-friendly automation system that can operate independently, analyze its own performance through structured logging, and continuously improve its automation strategies without human intervention.

  - `xml.etree.ElementTree` for UI XML parsing
  - `logging` for comprehensive logging system
  - `time` for operation delays and timing

## Build and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.7+** must be installed
2. **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** must be installed and accessible in PATH
3. **Android device** with USB debugging enabled
4. **Douyin app** installed on the target device

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Verify ADB installation
adb version

# Connect Android device and verify
adb devices

# Should show your device in the list
```

### Running the Application (Fully Autonomous)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/ADB_Douyin

# Full autonomous mode (no human interaction required)
python smart_douyin_automator.py --autonomous

# AI agent mode with continuous learning
python smart_douyin_automator.py --ai-agent --learn

# Batch processing mode for AI agents
python smart_douyin_automator.py --batch --config-file config/strategy_configs/aggressive.yaml

# Performance analysis and self-optimization
python smart_douyin_automator.py --analyze-performance --optimize
```

### Autonomous Operation Modes
1. **Full Autonomous Mode**: Zero human interaction, complete decision-making autonomy
2. **AI Agent Integration**: Designed for integration with AI agents and LLM systems
3. **Continuous Learning**: Self-improvement through performance analysis and strategy optimization
4. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple devices/accounts with intelligent load balancing
5. **Performance Optimization**: Real-time strategy adjustment based on success metrics

## Code Quality Standards

### Critical Requirements
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Functions must not exceed complexity of 15
- **Line Length**: Maximum 79 characters per line (PEP 8 compliance)
- **Function Length**: Maximum 50 lines per function
- **Documentation**: All public functions must have docstrings
- **Error Handling**: All operations must have proper exception handling with logging

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide strictly
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer explicit over implicit code
- Use type hints where applicable
- No hardcoded strings or magic numbers

### Development Strategy
**CRITICAL**: This project focuses on production-ready, modular, AI-agent-friendly architecture.

- **NO simple test versions**: Never create simplified or demo versions of functionality
- **Modular architecture required**: All code must be properly modularized and reusable
- **AI agent integration**: Code must be designed for AI agent consumption and control
- **Autonomous operation**: All functionality must work without human interaction
- **Self-improvement capability**: Systems must analyze and optimize their own performance
- **Structured logging for AI**: Logs must be parseable and actionable by AI agents

## AI-Agent-Friendly Logging System

The project implements a sophisticated structured logging system designed for AI agent consumption and analysis:

### Structured Log Categories
- `logs/operations/`: Timestamped operational logs with structured data for AI parsing
- `logs/performance/`: Performance metrics, success rates, and optimization opportunities
- `logs/decisions/`: Decision-making processes and reasoning chains for AI learning
- `logs/errors/`: Detailed error context with recovery strategies and root cause analysis
- `logs/improvements/`: Self-optimization actions and their effectiveness measurements

### AI-Parseable Log Formats
- **JSON Structure**: All logs use structured JSON format for easy AI parsing
- **Contextual Data**: Rich context including state, environment, and decision factors
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantifiable success/failure rates and timing data
- **Action Outcomes**: Clear mapping of actions to results for learning algorithms
- **Strategy Effectiveness**: Data on which automation strategies work best when

### Example Usage
```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Success logging
logger.info(f"ADB connection established: device_id={device_id}")

# Error logging with exception details
logger.error(f"UI analysis failed: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)

# Debug logging for detailed tracing
logger.debug(f"Found {len(elements)} UI elements for analysis")
```

- Comprehensive logging of all error conditions
- Graceful degradation when possible
- User-friendly error messages with technical details in logs

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Always check code quality first**: Run `get_errors` to identify issues
2. **Fix quality issues**: Address cognitive complexity, line length, and style issues
3. **Add comprehensive logging**: Every new feature must have detailed logging
4. **Test through logging**: Validate functionality using the integrated test mode
5. **Document changes**: Update docstrings and comments as needed

### Validation Steps
1. **Syntax Check**: `python -m py_compile main.py`
2. **Code Quality**: Ensure no cognitive complexity or style violations
3. **Functional Testing**: Run detailed test mode and review logs
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify complete workflow with actual device

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Never create demo or test files (use logging instead)
- Don't build simple/demo versions - always build production-ready modular code
- Never require human interaction - design for full autonomy
- Don't ignore code quality warnings
- Always handle exceptions with proper logging  
- Don't use print() for debugging (use structured logging)
- Avoid hardcoded device IDs or paths
- Don't skip error handling for ADB operations
- Never create non-modular monolithic code
- Don't design for human operation - design for AI agent control

## ADB Command Patterns

### Common Operations
```python
# Device connection check
adb_result = subprocess.run(['adb', 'devices'], capture_output=True, text=True)

# UI XML dump
subprocess.run(['adb', 'exec-out', 'uiautomator', 'dump', '/dev/tty'], 
               capture_output=True, text=True)

# Element interaction
subprocess.run(['adb', 'shell', 'input', 'tap', str(x), str(y)])
```

### Error Conditions to Handle
- Device not connected or unauthorized
- ADB daemon not running  
- UI dump failures or timeouts
- Invalid XML response from device
- Permission denied for input commands

## Performance Considerations

- **ADB command latency**: Each command has ~100-500ms overhead
- **UI XML parsing**: Large screens may have 1000+ elements
- **Network delays**: Wireless ADB connections are slower
- **Rate limiting**: Add delays between operations to avoid overwhelming the device

## Security Notes

- Never log sensitive user information
- Device interactions require explicit user consent
- ADB debugging must be manually enabled by user
- All operations are performed locally (no network data transmission)
